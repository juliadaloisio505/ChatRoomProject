# Chat Room Project

# Project Inspiration

This project aims to explore how multithreading and socket programming functions within the Java langauge. A chat room lends itself nicely to explore these technologies. 

# How It Works

This project allows for communication between 2+ terminals on the same device or terminals on 2+ different devices. It is fairly simple to set up. In order for the project to work as intended, terminals must be connected to the same remote server.
